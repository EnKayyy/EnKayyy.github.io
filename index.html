<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>My name is Nikita Kumar, and I am senior at Michigan State University. I will earn a Bachelors degree in Physics in 2017, and I am also well-versed in Computer Science. <p>
<br/> Indeed, I have a facility for some of the languages. I know C++, Python, Java, HTML, Mathematica, and briefly worked around Matlab. In addition, I excel in cross-cultural communication, speaking English, Hindi and knowing some Sanskrit and Spanish. <br/>

<br/> I have spent the last two years working at the Physics Education Research Lab at Michigan State (PERL@MSU), an interdisciplinary collaboration that studies how students as undergrads learn Physics and engage in Physics practice. My accomplishments at the lab include writing the research paper “Investigating how students connect essential scientific ideas across the disciplines.”, doing an in depth Textbook Analysis for various science concepts and comparing how these scientific phenomena explained and taught in the class related to number of students' responses in the interviews conducted. <br/>

<br/> No matter the scientific topic, I am enthusiastic about learning new ideas and putting them to use. A real analytical thinker, I am skilled at applying theories to real-world problems. Even as I take a meticulous approach to work projects, I maintain the ability to make everyone feel at ease. In the research lab, I am known by my peers and superiors as an all-around team player, eager to pitch in anywhere that’s needed and pinch hit when a problem arises. <br/>

<br/> After graduation, I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge in the STEM fields and 
contribute to the mission and growth of a company or educational institution. I’m open to
working anywhere, but I am particularly seeking opportunities in Michigan, Chicago, New York, and
California. <br/>

<br/>If you’re looking for a talented communicator in STEM who’s ready to hit the ground running, please 
connect with me on LinkedIn or contact me directly. <br/>
